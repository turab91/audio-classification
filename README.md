# audio-classification
classify musical instruments from sound clip using neural networks


- Audio files of each class

# MFCC
* sampling frequency = 16kHz
* frame size =  25ms. 
* nsamples = 0.025 x 16000 = 400 samples
* step size = 10ms = 160 samples
* window = hamming

- MFCC of the audio files
